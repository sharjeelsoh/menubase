          <p>
          i&apos;m a software developer at beyond bank, focused on building reliable, user-focused solutions that make a real impact. with a background in full-stack development and a strong foundation from my university studies, i&apos;ve worked across the entire software development lifecycle, from initial concept to deployment.
          i care about writing clean, maintainable code and enjoy solving problems that help teams and customers work better. <br></br><br></br>
          when i&apos;m not coding, i&apos;m usually on a long walk listening to cal newport. i&apos;m really into cool, unusual tech â€” old sony walkmans, retro gadgets, anything with buttons and a bit of soul. not a fan of phones or social media (i know... the irony).
          <br></br><br></br>i like running, camping, coffee, and music.
